# How to integrate with `systemd-resolved`

````{only} diataxis
```{important}
This guide applies to managed bridge networks only.
```
````

If the system that runs LXD uses `systemd-resolved` to perform DNS lookups, you should notify `resolved` of the domains that LXD can resolve.
To do so, add the DNS servers and domains provided by a LXD network bridge to the `resolved` configuration.

```{note}
The {config:option}`network-bridge-network-conf:dns.mode` option must be set to `managed` or `dynamic` if you want to use this feature.

Depending on the configured {config:option}`network-bridge-network-conf:dns.domain`, you might need to disable DNSSEC in `resolved` to allow for DNS resolution.
This can be done through the `DNSSEC` option in `resolved.conf`.
```

## Configure resolved

To add a network bridge to the `resolved` configuration, specify the DNS addresses and domains for the respective bridge.

DNS address
: You can use the IPv4 address, the IPv6 address or both.
  The address must be specified without the subnet netmask.

  To retrieve the IPv4 address for the bridge, use the following command:

      lxc network get <network_bridge> ipv4.address

  To retrieve the IPv6 address for the bridge, use the following command:

      lxc network get <network_bridge> ipv6.address

DNS domain
: To retrieve the DNS domain name for the bridge, use the following command:

      lxc network get <network_bridge> dns.domain

  If this option is not set, the default domain name is `lxd`.

Use the following commands to configure `resolved`:

    resolvectl dns <network_bridge> <dns_address>
    resolvectl domain <network_bridge> ~<dns_domain>

```{note}
When configuring `resolved` with the DNS domain name, you should prefix the name with `~`.
The `~` tells `resolved` to use the respective name server to look up only this domain.

Depending on which shell you use, you might need to include the DNS domain in quotes to prevent the `~` from being expanded.
```

For example:

    resolvectl dns lxdbr0 192.0.2.10
    resolvectl domain lxdbr0 '~lxd'

```{note}
Alternatively, you can use the `systemd-resolve` command.
This command has been deprecated in newer releases of `systemd`, but it is still provided for backwards compatibility.

    systemd-resolve --interface <network_bridge> --set-domain ~<dns_domain> --set-dns <dns_address>
```

The `resolved` configuration persists as long as the bridge exists.
You must repeat the commands after each reboot and after LXD is restarted, or make it persistent as described below.

## Make the `resolved` configuration persistent

There are two approaches to automating `systemd-resolved` configuration to ensure that it persists when the LXD bridge network is re-created. Use only one of these approaches, described below.

The first approach is recommended because it is more resilient. It applies your desired configuration whenever your system is rebooted, _and_ whenever the LXD bridge network is re-created outside of a system reboot. For example, updating and restarting LXD can occasionally cause its bridge network to be re-created.

If you are unable to use the recommended approach, the alternative approach can be used. The alternative approach applies your desired configuration only when your system is rebooted. If LXD re-creates its bridge network outside of a system reboot, you must reapply the configuration manually.

### Recommended approach

#### Create a `systemd` network file

Get the network bridge address with the following command:

```bash
lxc network get lxdbr0 ipv4.address
```

Create a `systemd` network file named `/etc/systemd/network/<network_bridge>.network` with the following content:

```
[Match]
Name=<network_bridge>
[Network]
Address=<network_bridge_address>
DNS=<dns_address>
Domains=~<dns_domain>
```

Example file content for `/etc/systemd/network/lxdbr0.network` (insert your own DNS value):

```
[Match]
Name=lxdbr0
[Network]
Address=10.167.146.1/24
DNS=10.167.146.1
Domains=~lxd
```

#### Apply the updated configuration

If you have rebooted since you first installed LXD, you only need to reload `systemd-resolved`:

    systemctl restart systemd-resolved.service

If you have _not_ rebooted your system since you first installed LXD, you must either:

1. reboot the system, or
1. reload `systemd-networkd` (to reload the `.network` files) and restart `lxd` (to add the routing):

```
networkctl reload
snap restart lxd
```

You can test that the updated configuration was applied by running:

```
resolvectl status
```

The output should contain a section similar to the example shown below. You should see the configured DNS server and the `~lxd` domain:

```
[...]
Link 4 (lxdbr0)
    Current Scopes: DNS
         Protocols: -DefaultRoute +LLMNR -mDNS -DNSOverTLS DNSSEC=no/unsupported
Current DNS Server: 10.167.146.1
       DNS Servers: 10.167.146.1
        DNS Domain: ~lxd
[...]
```

### Alternative approach

```{warning}
This approach only automates applying your desired configuration when your system is rebooted. If LXD re-creates its bridge network outside of a system reboot, you must reapply the configuration manually with the following command:

    systemctl restart lxd-dns-<bridge_network>.service

Example:

    systemctl restart lxd-dns-lxdbr0.service
```

Create a `systemd` unit file named `/etc/systemd/system/lxd-dns-<network_bridge>.service` with the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=LXD per-link DNS configuration for <network_bridge>
BindsTo=sys-subsystem-net-devices-<network_bridge>.device
After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-<network_bridge>.device

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/resolvectl dns <network_bridge> <dns_address>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/resolvectl domain <network_bridge> <dns_domain>
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/resolvectl revert <network_bridge>
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=sys-subsystem-net-devices-<network_bridge>.device
```

Replace `<network_bridge>` in the file name and content with the name of your bridge (for example, `lxdbr0`).
Also replace `<dns_address>` and `<dns_domain>` as described in {ref}`network-bridge-resolved-configure`.

Then enable and start the service with the following commands:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable --now lxd-dns-<network_bridge>

If the respective bridge already exists (because LXD is already running), you can use the following command to check that the new service has started:

    sudo systemctl status lxd-dns-<network_bridge>.service

You should see output similar to the following:

```{terminal}
:input: sudo systemctl status lxd-dns-lxdbr0.service

‚óè lxd-dns-lxdbr0.service - LXD per-link DNS configuration for lxdbr0
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/lxd-dns-lxdbr0.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead) since Mon 2021-06-14 17:03:12 BST; 1min 2s ago
    Process: 9433 ExecStart=/usr/bin/resolvectl dns lxdbr0 n.n.n.n (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
    Process: 9434 ExecStart=/usr/bin/resolvectl domain lxdbr0 ~lxd (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 9434 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
```

To check that `resolved` has applied the settings, use `resolvectl status <network_bridge>`:

```{terminal}
:input: resolvectl status lxdbr0

Link 6 (lxdbr0)
      Current Scopes: DNS

       LLMNR setting: yes

  DNSOverTLS setting: no
      DNSSEC setting: no
    DNSSEC supported: no
  Current DNS Server: n.n.n.n
         DNS Servers: n.n.n.n
          DNS Domain: ~lxd
```
